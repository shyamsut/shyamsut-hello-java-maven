ðŸ“Œ Jenkins + Maven Build Job â€” CI/CD Demonstration
Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and execution of a Continuous Integration pipeline using Jenkins and Maven to automate the build process of a Java application.
The setup represents a foundational CI/CD workflow â€” integrating source code, compiling, packaging, and verifying successful builds.

 ---
Objective
To showcase the ability to:

Configure Jenkins for automated builds.

Integrate Maven for dependency management and build automation.

Produce deployable Java artifacts with a reliable, repeatable process.

Present clear, measurable build results through Jenkins console logs.

--- 

Key Tools Used
Jenkins â€“ Automation server for managing the CI/CD pipeline.

Maven â€“ Build automation and dependency management tool for Java.

Java JDK â€“ Core environment for compiling and running Java applications.

Git (optional) â€“ Version control system for managing source code.

---

Implementation Process
Project Setup

Structured a basic Java application with a clean project hierarchy.

Defined a Maven project configuration for build consistency.

Jenkins Configuration

Configured global tools to include a Maven installation within Jenkins.

Ensured JDK availability for compilation tasks.

Created a Freestyle Jenkins job to automate the build workflow.

---

Pipeline Execution

Triggered a Maven build directly from Jenkins.

Monitored real-time logs through the Jenkins Console Output.

Verified a successful build with packaged Java artifacts ready for deployment.

Validation

Checked Jenkins build history for consistent results.

Archived build artifacts for reference and reuse.

---
Outcome
Fully automated build process from source code to deployable package.

Demonstrated a repeatable, scalable CI/CD workflow adaptable to larger projects.

Provided evidence of CI/CD capabilities through screenshots of Jenkins configuration, build execution, and successful output.

Deliverables
Screenshot of build console output showing BUILD SUCCESS.

---

Professional Relevance
This task demonstrates:

Understanding of CI/CD fundamentals.

Hands-on experience in Jenkins job configuration.

Practical Maven integration for enterprise Java applications.

Capability to set up automated, reproducible, and maintainable build environments â€” a critical skill for DevOps and software engineering roles.
